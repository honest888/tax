            <h2>Section 2. Scope of Representation Services</h2>
            <p>Republic Tax's representation of client will include and is limited to the following services:</p>
            <p>Tax years owed to Federal: {{YO}}<br>
              Tax years not filed Federal: {{YNF}}<br>{{YYY}}</p>
            <p class="bold">The following services are being contracted for. Please see Appendix C below for full description: </p>
            <p style="min-height:200px;">{{SN}}</p>
            <h2>Section 3. Compliance</h2>
            <p>In order to maintain compliance per Internal Revenue Service and state agency guidelines for the resolution contracted for client, we highly recommend annual returns to be performed, completed and submitted by Republic Tax on your behalf.This process ensures that full compliance is maintained and you do not default on any resolution that requires a minimum compliance term to remain in effect. Failure to remain compliant will result in offer or installment default and render any resolution void. To avoid such a costly error, client will maintain compliance by performing annual personal (1040 or 1040EZ) or business returns (1040 Schedule C,1120,1065) for a minimum fee of $395.00 and $800, respectively depending on complexity.<br>
            To maintain such compliance, please indicate on Appendix A below. Client must supply Republic Tax with all tax forms necessary to complete returns in a timely manner fifteen (15) days prior to submittal due date. Failure to do so may result in added fees and penalties from federal and state agencies and result in non compliance of offered and established services.Terms of such service are during the duration of the resolution engagement and for a period of three (3) years from the date of resolution completion.</p>

            <p>All retainers and fees for services are earned when paid. See APPENDIX D for Fee Schedule. Because the majority of our services are performed at the beginning of each engagement, no refunds are given. All invoices are due upon presentation. Failure to pay either the retainer request or invoices shall cause our firm to immediately stop providing services without further notice. The fee applies to those services indicated in Section 2 of this agreement and is limited for the term of this agreement.</p>
            <p>Any obligations on our part become null and void if you fail to provide us with information on a timely manner or if you provide us with false and misleading information. All unpaid fees shall become immediately due. Timely manner is defined as five (5) business days from the request date.</p>

            <td style="padding-top:20px">RTR utilizes a team of attorneys, Certified Public Accountants (CPAs), IRS Enrolled Agents (EAs), and other professionals to perform tax resolution, mediation, and preparation services. At the commencement of this agreement, RTR will file a Power of Attorney (POA) on behalf of the CLIENT with the appropriate taxing
authority(s).<br>
            Once the POA has been executed, RTR will conduct a thorough investigation—using financial information provided by the client—to determine CLIENT'S outstanding tax liability and whether CLIENT is in filing compliance. Based on the findings of the investigation, RTR will prepare a final resolution tax plan in accordance with the legal collections options provided by the Internal Revenue Service. This plan will be prepared, submitted, and negotiated with the appropriate taxing authority(s).
            <br>
            RTR will provide the best tax resolution possible to CLIENT, based on CLIENT'S individual circumstance.
Resolution may include an installment agreement, Offer in Compromise, penalty abatement, Currently Non-Collectible status, etc.; however, not every type of resolution is available to every client, and RTR will solely determine the best resolution based on the CLIENT'S individual circumstance.<br>
            Each taxing authority decides the outcome of all requests made before it, and no specific resolution is ever guaranteed. In addition, none of the services can be relied upon to detect errors or illegal acts that may exist; however, RTR will inform CLIENT of any such matters as they occur. The amount of an Offer in Compromise is not based upon a national or overall average of tax debt forgiveness rates, but on the unique facts of each taxpayer. RTR will perform its duties in a manner consistent with the degree of care and skill ordinarily exercised by members of the same profession currently practicing under similar circumstances, in providing services under this Agreement.
